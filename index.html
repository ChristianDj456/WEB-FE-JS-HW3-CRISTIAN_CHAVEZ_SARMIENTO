      <h2>1. JavaScript Async</h2>
      <div class="description">
        <p>
          JavaScript is a single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous language.
          This means that JavaScript code is executed in a sequence, one
          statement at a time, and it can perform other tasks while waiting for
          asynchronous operations to complete.
        </p>
        <p>There are several ways to handle asynchronous code in JavaScript:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>setTimeout and setInterval</li>
          <li>Callback functions</li>
          <li>Promise</li>
          <li>Async/Await</li>
          <li>Event Loop</li>
        </ul>
        <button onclick="runFirstExample()">Run Example</button>
      </div>
      <div class="code">
        <pre><code>
          // Example 1: setTimeout and asynchronous execution
          console.log('1. Starting execution');
          
          setTimeout(() => {
              console.log('3. Asynchronous Task Completed (after 2 seconds)');
          }, 2000);
          
          console.log('2. Code continues executing without waiting for asynchronous task');
          
          // Output:
          // 1. Starting execution.
          // Code continues executing without waiting for the asynchronous task.
          // 3. Asynchronous Task Completed (after 2 seconds)
        </code></pre>

      <h2>2. Callback</h2>
      <div class="description">
        <p>
          A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed once a specific task is completed. Callbacks are commonly used to handle asynchronous tasks in JavaScript, such as API requests, timers, and file reading operations, where you want certain code to execute after an operation finishes.
          How Callbacks Work
          In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned from functions, and stored in variables. A callback function allows us to delay the execution of a function until a certain operation completes. This is especially useful for tasks that take time, like fetching data from a server
        </p>

      <div class="code">
        <pre><code>
          // Example 2: Callback to handle asynchronous data
          function fetchData(callback) {
              console.log('Fetching data from API...');
          
              setTimeout(() => {
                  const data = 'Fetched data: { “user”: “John”, “age”: 30 }';
                  callback(data);
              }, 1000);
          }
          
          function displayData(data) {
              console.log(data);
          }
          
          fetchData(displayData);
          
          // Output:
          // Fetching data from the API....
          // Fetched data: { “user”: “John”, “age”: 30 }

      <h2>3. Promise</h2>
      <div class="description">
        <p>
          A Promise is a special JavaScript object that represents the eventual result (success or failure) of an asynchronous operation. Promises simplify how we handle asynchronous code, offering a more structured and readable way to manage asynchronous actions compared to the traditional callback approach. Promises are especially useful when you have to perform multiple asynchronous operations in sequence, handle errors, or deal with complex scenarios like loading data from a server.
        </p>
        <h3>The Lifecycle of a Promise</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Pending: Initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.</li>
          <li>Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully.</li>
          <li>Rejected: The operation failed.</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="code">
        <pre><code>
          // Example 3: Using Promises
          function fetchDataPromise() {
              return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                  console.log('Fetching data (Promise)...');
                  
                  setTimeout(() => {

                      } else {
                          reject('Error: Could not obtain data');
                      }

      <h2>4. Async/Await</h2>
      <div class="description">
        <p>
          Async/Await is a more modern way to work with asynchronous operations in JavaScript, introduced in ES2017. It is built on top of promises, providing a cleaner and more readable syntax for handling asynchronous code. Async/Await allows you to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves more like synchronous code, making it easier to understand, maintain, and debug.
        </p>
        <p>
          In essence, Async/Await is a syntactic sugar over promises. It simplifies promise-based code by allowing you to use await to pause the execution of a function until a promise is resolved or rejected, without the need for chaining .then() or .catch() methods.
        </p>
        <h3>Key Features of Async/Await</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Synchronous Appearance: Although the code is still asynchronous, it is written in a style that looks more like synchronous code. This makes it easier to read and reason about.</li>
          <li>Built on Promises: Async/Await is built on top of promises, so it offers all the features of promises (such as error handling and chaining) but in a more structured and readable form.</li>
          <li>Error Handling: With Async/Await, error handling becomes simpler. You can use the try/catch blocks around await to handle errors, just like you would in synchronous code.</li>
        </ol>

      </div>
      <div class="code">
        <pre><code>
          // Example 4: Using Async/Await
          async function fetchDataWithAsyncAwait() {
              console.log('Fetching data with async/await...');
          
              try {
                  const data = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                      setTimeout(() => {
                          const success = true;
                          if (success) {
                              resolve('Data obtained: { “product”: “Smartphone”, “price”: 1000 }');
                          } else {
                              reject('Error: Could not obtain data');

      <h2>5. Event Loop</h2>
      <div class="description">
        <p>
          The Event Loop is a core mechanism in JavaScript that enables asynchronous and non-blocking operations, despite the language being single-threaded. JavaScript’s single-threaded nature means it can only perform one task at a time. However, with the help of the Event Loop, JavaScript can manage multiple tasks without blocking the main thread, such as handling user interactions, executing scripts, and running animations, all while waiting for asynchronous tasks like fetching data from a server or setting timers to complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without the Event Loop, JavaScript would be unable to handle tasks such as network requests, timers, or I/O operations effectively, since these tasks take time to complete. The Event Loop is responsible for managing these operations in such a way that JavaScript remains responsive and efficient.

// Example 5: Demonstrating the Event Loop
console.log('Start');

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Inside Timeout');
}, 0);

console.log('End');

// Output:
// Start
// End
// Inside Timeout (processed later by the event loop)
